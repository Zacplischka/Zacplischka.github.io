    "INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "1. Generate ONLY the SQL query, no explanations or markdown\n",
    "2. Use PostgreSQL syntax\n",
    "3. Always include relevant columns in SELECT\n",
    "4. Use appropriate WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY clauses\n",
    "5. For player names from player_stats: player_first_name || ' ' || player_last_name AS player_name\n",
    "6. For player names from player_details: \"firstName\" || ' ' || \"surname\" AS player_name\n",
    "7. For date ranges, use date format 'YYYY-MM-DD'\n",
    "8. For averages, use ROUND(AVG(column), 2)\n",
    "9. For top performers, use ORDER BY ... DESC LIMIT n\n",
    "10. Always end queries with semicolon\n",
    "11. For season filtering on player_stats: use EXTRACT(YEAR FROM match_date::date) = 2024\n",
    "12. For season filtering on player_details: use season = 2024\n",
    "13. When joining tables: SELECT ... FROM player_stats ps JOIN player_details pd ON ps.player_id = pd.id\n",
    "14. IMPORTANT: match_date is stored as varchar, always cast to date: match_date::date\n",
    "15. IMPORTANT: Use double quotes around camelCase column names: \"firstName\", \"surname\", \"heightInCm\", etc.\n",
